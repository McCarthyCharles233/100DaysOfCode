Day 9 of #100daysofcodechallenge #100daysofcode 
I enrolled in Harvard University CS50W (Web Development Course) via edX, 
Project 0 from week 0 instructs us to create the google frontend. 
I cloned the google search page
Pages like the image search page and advanced search page will be added 
and the UI improved in the subsequent days
